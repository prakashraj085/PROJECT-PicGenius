This Image Generator project is a web application that harnesses the power of OpenAI's image generation technology. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. By integrating OpenAI's capabilities, users can input textual descriptions, and the application processes this input on the server side to generate visually stunning images. The server, built with Node.js and Express.js, handles incoming requests, communicates with OpenAI's image
generation API, and returns the generated images to the user.
